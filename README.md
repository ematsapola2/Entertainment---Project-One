## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

# Entertainment(movie/tv show)

This dataset explores the fascinating world of entertainment (movies and tv shows). It shows the movies/datasets which were watched/streamed the most by the public. 
It presents the preference and behaviour of audiences towards different type of movies/tv shows.
This dataset is from Kaggle. 

The dataset is used to show the type of movies/series people preferred to watch from. This dataset contains movies and tv shows, therefore, we are going to have a look at the type of media people preferred to watch based on the data.

# ABOUT THE DATA

The dataset consists of the following:
•	Id
This column consists of unique Ids which are unique to each movie/ tv show. The Id is a unique Id created for each movie/tv show.


•	Original_title
This column consists of the movie/ tv show names which people preferred to watch or streamed the most. 



•	Original_language
This includes the language the movies/tv shows were originally produced. The table consists of different languages, in which movies were produced in.


•	Release_date
this dataset refers to the date when a movie or TV show was released to the public. Here we are looking at the most recent released movies/tv shows between 2019 – 2013.


•	Popularity
This dataset refers to the level of public interest and engagement in a movie/tv show. 
As in which movies/tv shows were most popular.

•	vote_average
this dataset refers to the average rating given to a particular movie or TV. This is the average ratings for each movie/tv show.
the rating is up to 10. or the highest is 10.
How many ratings out of 10 did people give the movie while watching it.


•	The vote_count
This dataset refers to the number of votes or ratings received by a particular movie, or the number of votes received by the movie/tv show based on people.



•	media_type
This dataset refers to the type of content, whether it is a movie or a TV show.


•	Adult
The "adults" attribute is usually represented as a Boolean data type, which can have values of true or false to indicate the presence or absence of a specific characteristic (in this case, whether the user is an adult or not).
There are 0 users marked as "true," meaning there are no users marked as adults in the dataset.

# ABOUT DATA CLEANING

Have a look at my .... document to have a close look at the data cleaned and how I cleaned the data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CONCLUSION ABOUT MY ANALYSIS

Based on my analysis of the data, the total vote count on movies is # 9707496 and tv shows # 7011684. A lot of people preferred to watch movies than they do tv shows. 
The average vote on movies is # 804,933333333333 and tv shows #1744,2.

Based on the results of my analysis,  many movies and tv shows are released in English. It's pretty evident because a lot of platforms release movies and tv shows in English. 
However, some countries where English is not their native language are releasing their movies in thier own native language, but there are subtitles for people who do not understand those language. but would like to watch. 
We have South African platforms like Showmax, which most of its content is in different South African languages, but there's always an option for subtitles for people who don't understand the language.


The dataset contains movies released between 2019 and 2023. Based on my analysis. However, a lot of the movies in the dataset were released in 2023. Most of the movies were released in March of 2023.

# Abnormalities/Limitations

Even though the results show me that most movies/tv shows are released in English, I have noticed some errros on the data. The countries Spain, China and Korea have the same number of watched movies, which seems odd since they are different countires. This finding might be unexpected or could indicate potential issues with data collection or recording.

Based on the dataset, more data could have been included to find better results. The dataset was limited, also regarding the genres of movies that were chosed for this dataset. The dataset doesn't include any genre to indentify what genre was chosed.

Based on the analysis, I have noticed that the media type 'tv show' has empty fields under the column 'original_title'. There are no records of the title names. The data could have been incomplete, or the there were errors when uploading the data.
